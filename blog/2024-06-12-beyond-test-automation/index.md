Autonomous testing represents the next significant leap in testing methodologies. This approach leverages the power of autonomous bots, learning algorithms, and AI/ML technologies. Autonomous testing eliminates the need for programming skills by generating tests automatically. This combines the simplicity of manual testing with the speed of automated testing, automating remaining manual activities such as result analysis and maintenance.

However, a critical question arises: Is autonomous testing truly the next era, or is it just an improved form of test automation?

## Understanding Autonomous Testing

Various sources classify autonomous testing into six levels:

- **Level 0 - Manual**: Entirely manual testing with no automation.
- **Level 1 - Assisted Automated Testing**: Some automation assists human testers.
- **Level 2 - Partial Automated Testing**: Automation handles specific tasks, but humans oversee the process.
- **Level 3 - Integrated Automated Testing**: Automation is integrated into the testing process, with significant but not total control.
- **Level 4 - Intelligent Automated Testing**: Automation is highly intelligent and capable, but still requires some human oversight.
- **Level 5 - Autonomous Testing**: The computer has full control of the testing process, making decisions and carrying out all testing actions without human intervention.

This classification mirrors the levels of autonomy seen in the automotive industry and reflects the gradual transition towards complete autonomy.

## The Hype and Reality of Autonomous Testing

In 2020, Gartner placed autonomous testing on their Hype Cycle for Agile and DevOps, predicting it would reach the Plateau of Productivity in 5 to 10 years. By 2022, this prediction was shortened to 2 to 5 years. Surprisingly, in 2023, autonomous testing disappeared from the cycle, replaced by AI-augmented testing. This shift underscores the dynamic nature of technological advancements in testing.

Regardless of the exact predictions or the final terminology adopted, the trajectory is clear: we are heading towards an era where human involvement in testing will be significantly reduced.

Enhancing existing automation involves augmenting software test automation practices with or without AI. This approach not only boosts efficiency but also reduces the margin of error and increases the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Here are some opportunities to enhance existing automation:

#### Predictive Test Selection

[Predictive test selection](/blog/predictive-test-selection/) uses AI and machine learning to analyze past test results, code changes, and other factors to predict which tests are likely to fail. This approach helps prioritize testing efforts, ensuring that the most critical and likely-to-fail areas of the code are tested first. By focusing on high-risk areas, teams can catch defects earlier, reduce testing time, and improve overall software quality.

#### Test Script Generation

Automating the creation of test scripts can significantly speed up the authoring and maintenance process while reducing human errors. AI-powered tools can analyze the application under test (AUT) and generate test scripts automatically, adapting to changes in the codebase. This not only reduces the time required to create and update test scripts but also ensures that the scripts are always in sync with the latest version of the application.

#### Self-Healed Locators

Self-healing locators automatically update in test cases when the structure or attributes of the page change. Traditional test automation scripts often fail when the UI changes, as locators become outdated. [Self-healing locators](/blog/self-healing-in-sw-test-automation/) use machine learning algorithms to identify and adapt to changes in the UI, ensuring that tests remain functional and reducing the need for manual intervention.

#### Autonomous Navigation/Interaction

Autonomous navigation and interaction eliminate the need for hardcoded scripts by generating AUT navigation and interaction on the fly. This makes tests more adaptive to changes in the application, as the AI can dynamically interact with the UI based on the current state of the application. This approach improves test coverage and reduces maintenance efforts, as the AI can handle changes in the application without requiring updates to the test scripts.

#### Image-Based (UI) Object Recognition

Image-based object recognition uses advanced image recognition techniques to identify objects in the UI. This is particularly useful when traditional locators, such as IDs or class names, are not available or reliable. By analyzing the visual representation of the UI, AI-powered tools can identify and interact with UI elements based on their appearance, making the tests more robust and adaptable to changes.

#### Visual Validations/Assertions

Visual validations and assertions ensure that UI elements are displayed correctly and look as expected. This technique can be used for testing graphical user interfaces (GUIs), ensuring that visual aspects such as layout, color, and fonts are correct. It can also be applied to report (PDF) testing, verifying that the content and formatting of generated reports meet the specified requirements. Visual validations provide an additional layer of testing that complements traditional functional tests.

#### Dynamic/Magic POM

Dynamic or magic Page Object Model (POM) techniques increase the maintenance efficiency of scripts by generating page objects dynamically. Traditional POM requires manual updates whenever the UI changes, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Dynamic POM techniques use AI to automatically generate and update page objects based on the current state of the UI, reducing maintenance efforts and ensuring that the tests remain up-to-date.

#### Smarter Reporting

Smarter reporting involves classifying test failures into different categories, such as environment issues, flaky tests, or actual bugs. By categorizing failures, teams can prioritize and focus on the most critical issues, improving the efficiency of the debugging process. Smarter reporting also provides better insights into the overall health of the application, helping teams identify recurring issues and trends that need to be addressed.
