Introductory Provisions<a href="#1-introductory-provisions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Introductory Provisions" title="Direct link to 1. Introductory Provisions">​</a></h2><p>1.1 In accordance with Section 1751 of the Civil Code, these Terms
of Use shall apply to contractual relationships being established
between the Provider on one side and legal entities or individual
entrepreneurs as clients on the other side regarding (i) the use of
Wopee platform operated by Provider and (ii) Services to be provided
by the Provider to Clients in connection with Wopee platform for a
consideration agreed between the Parties. The Wopee platform is not
intended for and cannot be used by consumers acting as Clients,
unless these Terms of use state otherwise.</p><p>1.2 These Terms of Use form an integral part of each contractual
relationship established between the Provider and a Client (i.e. of
each Contract in accordance with paragraph 3.1 below), whose subject
matter is the provision of Services by the Provider to the Client
under the Contract, unless explicitly otherwise agreed in specific
contractual provisions. These Terms of Use shall be binding upon the
Parties for the whole period of duration of the contractual
relationship until all receivables that have arisen between the
Provider and Client are settled in full. Any special regulation in
variance with these Terms of Use, that might possibly be agreed
between Provider and Client in writing, shall supersede and take
precedence over these Terms of Use in relation to a specific
business transaction and contractual relationship to the extent to
which the regulation stipulated in these Terms of Use differs from
the written agreement between Provider and Client. As regards to the
rest, these Terms of Use shall apply.</p><p>1.3 If any provision of these Terms of Use becomes invalid,
ineffective or unenforceable, to whatever degree or extent, under
the valid legal regulations, the validity, effectiveness,
enforceability or another legal perfectness of the remainder of
provisions shall not be affected thereby. Immediately after the
existence of any of the above-mentioned facts has been ascertained,
any such invalid, ineffective or unenforceable provision of the
Terms of Use or a written agreement between the Provider and Client
shall be replaced by a new wording of these Terms of Use or written
agreement, containing new contents of the concerned provision. The
same shall apply in the case of any legal gap.</p><p>1.4 The Provider may change the Terms of Use following the execution
of this Contract. The Provider shall notify the Client in writing of
a change in the Terms of Use, such notification can be done also by
way of email. If within 30 days following the delivery of the
written notification (email) regarding the changes to the Terms of
Use the Client fails to inform the Provider in writing that it does
not agree with the new wording of the Terms of Use, the new wording
of the Terms of Use shall become binding and shall replace the
original Terms of Use upon the expiry of a specified time limit of
30 days. If Client expresses its disapproval of the new wording of
the Terms of Use in the prescribed manner, the Contract shall
terminate on the last day of the contractual Term; the provisions of
Clause 5.4 hereof shall not apply. All fees and any other payments
made by the Client to the Provider before the termination of the
Contract according to this provision will always be considered as
payments made in accordance with the Contract and the Client shall
no right to any refund.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-interpretation">2. Interpretation<a href="#2-interpretation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.
