## Who we are

We are building bots to reduce waste in software development and testing.
Traditional testing approaches are slowing down development and are no longer scalable. We believed that test automation was the solution. This belief failed.

Almost everywhere these days we test using test automation tools, but this testing approach is still too slow and requires strong technical skills that are hard to find and develop. Even if we do succeed in automating our testing, we are then faced with exhausting maintenance.

Self-driving Bot
Independent testing bot, no automation required.

Our bots explore your Web App, learn how it works and it is ready for testing. Sometimes it is not human to ask humans to test (runnnig regression testing ... especially several times a week/day, runnig it on many configurations, etc.)
