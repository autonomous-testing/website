> ## Stop overpaying for visual testing. It doesnâ€™t have to suck.

Youâ€™re probably paying too much for visual testing tools that overcomplicate everything. The truth is, visual testing doesnâ€™t have to be this hard. It can be simple, affordable, and â€” dare we say â€” even enjoyable. Itâ€™s time for a change.

**Visual regression testing** is essential for ensuring that your web and mobile apps look perfect across browsers and devices. But with so many tools available, how do you choose the best one for your team? Two of the most popular options are **Applitools** and **Wopee.io**. Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison to help you decide.

### Stop struggling with bloated, expensive solutions and start testing with a tool that just works: Wopee.io ðŸ˜Ž

## Why Visual Regression Testing Matters

Visual regression testing ensures that visual elements of your app function correctly across different environments. It automates the detection of visual differences between baseline and actual images, saving teams countless hours of manual testing and preventing errors from reaching production.

## Applitools: Industry Giant but at a Price

Applitools is a well-known player in the **visual regression testing** space. Its **Visual AI** technology is praised for accuracy and it integrates with many testing frameworks like Selenium, Cypress, and WebDriverIO.

However, despite its popularity, Applitools customers report **mixed experiences** when it comes to its ease of use and pricing model:

- **Opaque Pricing**: One of the most common complaints is that Applitools does not disclose pricing on their website. Customers report needing to go through time-consuming negotiations to get pricing thatâ€™s tailored to their company, often resulting in higher-than-expected costs.
- **Expensive for Growing Teams**: Many users on G2 point out that Applitools' pricing escalates quickly as your team scales or your testing needs increase
  [[source]](https://www.g2.com/products/applitools/reviews).
- **Complex Setup**: While Applitools has powerful AI-powered features, some users mention that the tool can be difficult to implement, particularly when dealing with dynamic content or low-resolution images [[source]](https://www.g2.com/products/applitools/reviews).
- **High Maintenance**: Applitools may require **constant updates and fine-tuning**, which can increase the burden on teams that already have limited resources [[source]](https://www.g2.com/products/applitools/reviews).
