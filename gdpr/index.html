proper security of the transferred Personal Data. Security means
that the file being transferred will be at least compressed to the
ZIP or similar file format, and encoded using a safe password. A
safe password means a password with at least 8 characters containing
both alphanumeric (uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers) and
non-alphanumeric characters. The password must be agreed with the
addressee in advance and transferred safely; the transfer of a
password in an open email message is not considered safe; the same
applies to password changes.</p></li><li><p>The responsible representatives of the Parties shall select a
secure password and shall inform each other of the password in a
discrete manner.</p></li><li><p>The transfer of Personal Data by phone may only be used in
exceptional cases; the use of phone includes short text messages
(SMS), multimedia messages (MMS) or mobile applications with similar
functions. Personal data can only be provided by phone if: the
identity of the caller has been securely verified, it is certain
that no person other than the duly identified caller can attend the
call, and if the data are transferred between the controller and the
processor, between two controllers, or between the processor and a
sub-processor, it is certain that the data are properly recorded. If
data are transferred using an SMS, MMS, or an application with
similar functions, the message shall be deleted immediately after
the data have been properly recorded.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="article-viii-security-incident">Article VIII: Security Incident<a href="#article-viii-security-incident" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Article VIII: Security Incident" title="Direct link to Article VIII: Security Incident">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>If the personal data processor becomes aware of a security
